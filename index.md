Letâ€™s build this together!! Block Emperors will be a decentralized, community-driven, play-to-earn game universe filled with fictional Emperors and their armies where we can train and fight wars against other players. This game universe will run using Roblox, so the community can create its worlds and earn rewards for this. Also, players can collect our favorites Emperors and armies' NFTs, which can be used as Avatars, pictures on social networks, and others.


## Gameplay
Block Emperors is an RTS (Real-time strategy) game running on Roblox where the players can play with their own Heroes, build structures, and lead their armies to war. Additionally, the community can create new items building a rich metaverse where the wars will take place.

### Battling
Battles will happen in Roblox where players will control their Heroes. There will be different types of battles like `Battle Royal`, `Capture the flag` or `Rescue hostages`. Victors will earn rewards and items like special arms or treasures among other assets.

#### Tournaments
Block Emperors will organize online tournaments where players could earn prizes.

### Worlds
Block Emperor's worlds can be created by the community (DAO). This is a way for the community to earn rewards and contribute to the ecosystem.

## NFT Heroes Genesis Collection
Block Emperors will mint the NFT Heroes genesis collection. Each NFT represents a Hero that will have its skin to play in Roblox. The skin is different from the original NFT artwork.

## Tokens

### Block Emperors Dinars - $BED (Governance token)
Block Emperors Dinars (BED) are an ERC-20 governance tokens for the Block Emperor community. BED holders will be able to participate in governance decisions (votes). Players can earn $BED on tournaments, creating and adding maps to the game and through contributions to the community.

## Decentralized Organization
A DAO will be created to help evolve the community and game. BED distribution will help to decentralize ownership and become a community-owned Decentralized Organization. This process will happen as BED is distributed among players, with the founders ownership becoming less concentrated over time. The founders team will be able to vote with the locked tokens. This will prevent hostile actors from disrupting the game universe during the initial development. We estimate the founders team won't have the majority vote by 1Q 2024.

## Technology

We will use Roblox to create the the Block Emperors game and Ethereum as the blockchain for the NFTs and DAO.
